# adder-Test 2
Release Note:
This is a Verilog project meant to compare the speed and resource usage between Ripple-Carry, Carry-Lookahead, and Prefix Adders. This is done by measuring their critical-path delays, estimated maximum frequencies, and area, then considering their practical tradeoffs. These outcomes can be found in results/results.md.

Git Workflow:
1. To create the git repo, use git init then git remote add origin <repo_url>
2. Use git checkout -b <branch_name> to create and work on feature branches
3. Use git add <file_name> to stage changes and git commit -m "subject: description" to commit them to branch
4. Push branch into mainline with git push -u origin <branch_name>
5. Steps 2-4 should be repeated as needed to complete adder implementations.
