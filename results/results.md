# Synthesis Results

The synthesis measurements are only estimates as open-source synthesis libraries weren't functioning properly in my development environment, but the results do align with what was expected overall between each adder type. The specific measurements across 8, 16, 32, and 64 bit widths have been saved to the `summary_results.txt` file in this same directory.

Based on the results seen in summary_results.txt, as bit width grows the prefix adder sees the smallest increase in latency, followed by the carry-lookahead adder then the ripple-carry adder with the largest increase in latency. For area, the carry-lookahead adder sees the largest increase in transistor count as the bit width increases, with the prefix adder seeing a smaller increase and the ripple-carry adder seeing the smallest increase of the three adder types. This means that when speed is the only priority or when a balance in speed and area is needed, the prefix adder is the best option. For size reduction as the only priority, the ripple-carry adder is the best option. Despite its good latency scaling, the carry-lookahead adder has poor area scaling that makes it an unreasonable option when compared to the other two adders.
